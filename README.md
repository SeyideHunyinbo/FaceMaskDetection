# FaceMaskDetection
This is an image classification problem, and the aim is to perform face mask detection using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) workflow in TensorFlow and OpenCV


# Dataset
* The dataset contains `train` (with 1315 images) and `test folders` (with 194 images), and each folder contains 2 subfolders (i.e., with_mask and without_mask), each having equal number of images for both train and test sets. A `with_mask` folder consists of images of people with mask, and the images of people without masks is stored in a `without_mask` folder.
